    <h1>Sri Lanka Economic Crisis (2015–2025)</h1>
    <p>A Comprehensive Macroeconomic Analysis</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Structural Weaknesses (2015–2019)</h2>
    <p>
      Sri Lanka entered the latter half of the 2010s with fragile macroeconomic fundamentals.
      The country ran persistent fiscal deficits above 5% of GDP, and public debt rose from
      78% of GDP in 2015 to nearly 94% by 2019. A major blow came in 2019 when sweeping tax cuts
      reduced government revenue by over 30%. This eroded the government’s capacity to invest
      or respond to crises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The economy heavily depended on foreign borrowing—primarily via short-term,
      dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. Imports far exceeded exports, leading to chronic
      current account deficits. These combined structural weaknesses left the economy highly
      vulnerable to any external shock.
    </p>

    <h2>2. COVID-19 & Economic Collapse (2020–2022)</h2>
    <p>
      The COVID-19 pandemic hit Sri Lanka at its most vulnerable. The tourism sector—
      a major foreign exchange earner—collapsed from $4.4 billion in 2018 to just $0.5 billion
      in 2021. Remittances declined sharply, and lockdowns paralyzed domestic activity.
      GDP contracted by -3.6% in 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an attempt to defend the rupee without adequate reserves, the government printed money,
      resulting in hyperinflation (~70% in mid-2022). Foreign reserves dropped from $7.6 billion
      in 2019 to below $2 billion by 2022. Import bans on essentials like fuel, food, and medicine
      triggered severe shortages, leading to public unrest.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Sovereign Default & Political Fallout (2022)</h2>
    <p>
      In April 2022, Sri Lanka defaulted on $51 billion in external debt, marking its first
      sovereign default. Widespread protests erupted due to inflation, shortages, and economic
      hardship. This led to the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crisis prompted Sri Lanka to seek IMF assistance. A $2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility
      was secured in March 2023, conditioned on deep structural reforms and fiscal tightening.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Recovery Measures & Structural Reforms (2023–2025)</h2>
    <p>
      Under IMF guidance, Sri Lanka initiated sweeping reforms. Taxes were reintroduced,
      subsidies curtailed, and the central bank gained independence. The rupee was floated,
      allowing market-based exchange rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inflation declined to ~15% by late 2023 and is expected to fall to single digits by 2025.
      GDP growth recovered mildly to 1.5% in 2023 and is forecasted at 3.5–4% by 2025.
      Tourism and remittance inflows are gradually recovering, although debt restructuring
      and fiscal consolidation remain ongoing challenges.

    <h2>7. Macroeconomic Concepts Applied</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fiscal Deficit:</strong> Persistent overspending without matching revenue.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance of Payments:</strong> Chronic current account deficits due to trade imbalance.</li>
      <li><strong>External Debt:</strong> High exposure to short-term, high-interest foreign loans.</li>
      <li><strong>Monetary Policy:</strong> Money printing caused hyperinflation.</li>
      <li><strong>Exchange Rate Management:</strong> Mismanaged peg led to a currency crash.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation & Expectations:</strong> Prices surged as public confidence fell.</li>
      <li><strong>Political Economy:</strong> Populist policies compromised long-term sustainability.</li>
    </ul>
